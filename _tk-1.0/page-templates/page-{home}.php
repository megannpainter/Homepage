<h4>Web Developer.</h4>
Currently, I'm learning to design and develop websites through HTML5, CSS, Javascript and Jquery.  Though not my major, it is a new interest of mine and something I hope to continue to pursue for both my personal interest and also to better prepare myself for work in the future.

<h4>Communication Strategist.</h4>
By brainstorming new ways to use media channels for your business, I aim to create interesting messages that will represent the company and engage your audience.  Each business has a different identity, a different story, and I want to create intriguing content for your clients to read, whether enhancing your social media sites or drafting promtional content for print or web dissemination.

<h4>Writer.</h4>
I've always dreamed of being a writer--a wake-up-in-the-morning-with-a-cup-of-coffee-and-a-journal-by-my-side writer.  For Young Author's day in elementary school, I'd write draft after draft Until I finally had the best book I could have possibly written for an 8-year-old.  To this day, those books still sit on my shelf.  Writing was the obvious choice for my career path, but author-style creative writing didn't suit me.  Coming to UNC-Chapel Hill and becoming part of the School of Media and Journalism gave the the opportunity to translate my writing and creativity into professional skills that I can use to help others tell their stories.

<h4>UNC Student.</h4>
"Born, bread and dead a Tarheel," they say, and it is 100 percent true.  During my time in Chapel Hill I've gotten the opportunity to become a part of one of the top journalism schools in the country.  The renaming of the school to the School of Media and Journalism shows how the school is evolving to help its students.  With the help of some amazing professors, I will soon graduate with an array of skills.

Outside of writing and work, my favorite thing to do is to snuggle with my best friend and best dog around Randy.
